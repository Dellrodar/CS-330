# CS-330
Repo of CS 330 portfolio entries

My final project for CS-330 was a 3D nightstand scene created in OpenGL using C++. The scene included multiple textured objects such as drawers, a lamp, and a picture frame. I focused on applying realistic materials, balanced lighting, and proper camera placement to make the scene feel natural. Throughout the process, I experimented with transparency, reflection, and texture mapping to bring everyday objects to life in a virtual environment.

# How do I approach designing software?

    ## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        - This project really helped me improve how I plan and visualize 3D spaces. I learned how to take something from real life, like my nightstand setup, and break it down into simple geometric shapes that could be built in OpenGL. Working with lighting, textures, and shaders showed me how small details such as reflection, roughness, and light placement can completely change how realistic something looks. I also became more confident in thinking about how materials and lighting work together to create the overall atmosphere of a scene.

    ## What design process did you follow for your project work?
        - I started by thinking out my scene and deciding which parts were most important to include. From there, I built each object one at a time, testing shapes, adjusting scales, and checking the lighting after each change. My process was very iterative: test, tweak, and test again. I reused transformation and shader logic wherever I could so updates stayed consistent. Each milestone gave me a chance to see how everything looked and make refinements before moving forward.

    ## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
        - The biggest takeaway is that design is not about getting everything perfect from the start. It is about experimenting, making changes, and improving along the way. That same mindset works for app or web design too. I plan to keep using this cycle of testing, visual feedback, and small adjustments in future projects. It keeps my workflow flexible and helps me adapt when something does not turn out as planned.

# How do I approach developing programs?

    ## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        - I learned how to think about data flow through the graphics pipeline. This meant understanding how vertex data, textures, and lighting connect between the CPU and GPU. I started breaking my code into smaller, reusable functions for transformations, lighting setup, and texture management. That organization made it easier to test and debug when something did not render correctly.

    ## How did iteration factor into your development?
        - Iteration was a key part of my workflow. Every time I built or changed an object, I tested it in the scene to see how it looked under different lighting. Sometimes things looked off, such as materials being too reflective or textures stretching, but each round of feedback helped me get closer to the final result. It reminded me that programming can feel like sculpting: you keep refining until everything looks right.

    ## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
        - At first, I focused mainly on getting objects to appear on screen and function correctly. As the project went on, I started paying more attention to structure, naming, and reusability. By the end, I cared just as much about organization and performance as I did about visual quality. The final version of my scene feels cleaner, easier to modify, and much closer to professional code.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

    ## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
        - Working with graphics helped me connect math concepts like linear algebra and geometry to something I could actually see in action. It gave me a stronger understanding of how transformations, matrices, and vector operations apply to real projects. That knowledge will carry over into future courses focused on data visualization, simulation, or artificial intelligence.

    ## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
        - This project helped me think more visually about problem-solving. Whether I am working on a user interface, a game, or an interactive dashboard, knowing how to design and optimize visual systems is a big advantage. It also made me better at using visuals to explain complex ideas, which is a valuable skill in any software engineering role.
